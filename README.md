# Affine_Hill_Cipher_DSP
I implemented affine Hill Cipher on TMS320C6416 with code composer
possibility of implementing software and hardware for the ffine_Hill_Cipher method on DSP boards was examined, and the correctness of the software and hardware implementation was verified through simulation using Simulink and code development in the MATLAB environment. The results obtained from the MATLAB code were compared with the results obtained from the C code executed on the DSP board, and they were found to be exactly the same
